## Fancy Tabs Stencil Demo

[Eric Bidelman](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors/ericbidelman) wrote an excellent article about [Shadow DOM v1: Self-Contained Web Components](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom).

Following on from his work I created a version using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/).

See the [example in action here](https://jagreehal.github.io/fancy-tabs-stencil-demo/).
